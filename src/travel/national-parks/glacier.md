# Glacier National Park

What a beautiful park!

Road tripped to Glacier over a long weekend.
Took ~9 hrs from UT to Glacier with a long stop in Missoula -- a surprisingly nice place, great northern woodland aesthetic.

## Camping

### Outside the park/during travel

- Lolo National Forest
- Flathead National Forest
  - Further north and camping is a little more out of the way, but close tot he park for earlier morning arrival/late departure
- Some small state parks around also provide potential options

### In the park and immediately around

- West Glacier
  - Quartz Creek
    - Only 8? campsites, first come first serve
    - Definitely bears in the area, although we did not have any problems
    - Small site with no potable water/supplies
    - Beautiful area deep in the woods, creek nearby is gorgeous
    - Outhouse style bathroom
    - Quartz Creek hiking trail is a quarter mile or less away, feels like you get lost in the woods
      - Do not recommend hiking alone, definitely have bear spray -- bear scat was on several places in just a mile of the trailhead
  - Logging Creek
    - Closed in 2023 for maintenance/road work I believe
  - Other
    - Polebridge is worth stopping in, they have some delicious huckleberry pastries
    - There isn't any gas out in this area for miles - be sure to fill up before heading out here
    - On a combination of dirt/gravel and paved roads, late season had several deep large muddy pools across the width of the road that cannot be avoided
- East Glacier
  - **Many Glacier**
    - Cannot recommend this one enough! RESERVATION ONLY however
    - Red Rock lake & falls trail is right next to the camping, must do trails
    - Pretty far out from town, ensure gas, sites have water
  - Chewing Black Bones campground is a good non-park option at reasonable cost
  - Rising Sun
    - Walk-up sites, but get there EARLY (before 6pm) to ensure a spot
    - Going to the sun road permit required (as I recall)
    - Has shuttles through park from this campground, so can make for a good base station
  - Saint Mary
    - Walk-up sites, reserve if possible however
    - No road permit required, shuttles from campground/visitor center through park
- Other
  - There are several other sites around, many require reservations however, particularly those in west glacier

## Hiking

### Highline Trail

~13+ miles if including Grinnell Glacier Overlook and any wandering.

We started the trail from Logan Pass, which made the trail much easier being downhill most of the time.
Parked a car at The Loop in the morning, took the shuttle up to Logan Pass, and hiked back down.
The parking in the park can fill up fast, no guarantee of anything open, we just got lucky.
If driving into the park and wanting parking, earlier is better.

This trail is beautiful! Many amazing views along the entire trail and wildlife if you pay attention.
From the start there are several serene rock and water features, coupled with the views across the mountains, including down to the northeastern edge of Lake McDonald.

At the turn off to the Overlook, we met some tenacious little chipmunks who were desperate for any crumb on our snack break.
The Overlook is INTENSE. A very challenging uphill battle, but it is more than worth it.
From the overlook, climbing a little further up the mountain gives views of the lower lake as well.
The wind was wild at the top of the pass/overlook, definitely have a jacket or windbreaker.
It is surprisingly easy to forget the wind with the views available, a stunning overlook across so much of the park and, naturally, the Grinnell Glacier.

The hike from the Overlook back to the Loop passes by the chalet which would be a fun place to stay.
Also a good spot for a snack break or just to cool down and collect more water just beyond if needed (water filter recommended of course).
The remainder from the chalet back to The Loop passed through amazing forests.

### Ptarmigan Tunnel

I did not hike this trail, but it was recommended to me by a Glacier native. At the top of the trail is apparenly an old tunnel carved through the mountain for horse and wagon travel. Long hike as well, with several other amazing spots from this trail.

### Red Rock Lake/Falls

10/10 must see this area while in glacier. The trail is relatively short, flat, and in decent shade, but beware of bears as there were a lot of signs of fresh bear activity.

The gentle hike follows along a series of small lakes and a stream up to the Red Rock Falls.
Red Rock Lake is just below the falls and has beaufil color gradients with blue water (likely from upstream glacial runoff) and deep red clay and dirt bed.
Take the time to appreciate the view, stopping by a number of the lakes and ponds I saw several deer and others witnessed a moose drinking from the water shortly before we arrived.
The mountains behind the falls had several mountain goats visible feeding their way across the cliff edges.
Amazing how they are able to traverse that terrain.
Recommended to bring binoculars or a camera with a particularly good zoom lense.
Even without, the serene color spectrum available in the late summer/early fall is already nearly overwhelming.
The falls themselves have a number of beautiful and semi-hidden spots so explore around and appreciate the sight from many angles, including the view back down to Red Rock Lake.

### Quartz Creek Trail

The last night of our trip we drove back through the park, stopping at several of the pullouts we missed before in favor of hikes.
We worked our way to Polebridge ranger station/park entrance and took camp in Quartz Creek.
Right next to the camp is the Quartz Creek trail which is a fairly popular multi-night trail that works up to Bowman Lake which we did not get time to visit.
The trail makes you feel nearly lost in the dense forest around, even within half a mile--definitely have your bear spray accessible and usable before even starting the hike.
The views are more limited in the first couple miles I covered (by myself as my hiking buddy was in some good pain from our hike the day before), but you feel like you discovered something amazing when the treeline does begin to break.
This would be one to go back to for an overnighter due to the relative quiet in this side of the park and you feel secluded and immersed.
If attempting an long day of an out-and-back to Quartz Creek Lake(s?), Quartz Creek campsite would be a good base camp but beware of notes above.

## Sights and Experiences

### Polebridge and West Glacier Camping

Polebridge is worth stopping into.
We picked up a hitch hicker heading out of the park and stopped in Polebridge to pick up any souvenirs and grabbed some pastries made from local berries.
The whole town feels like an old-timey outpost or western startup town, everyone was naturally friendly and fun.
The camping and experiences in West Glacier all felt immersive and secluded, the latter being among the most surprising for a very popular national park where West Glacier was the first time it didn't feel crowded or overly busy.
Granted, this could have been due to us wrapping up a long weekend there and most others having already left.

### East Glacier

Many Glacier is a reservation *ONLY* campsite! Did I write that down wrong in my trip planning notes? Definitely not...
However, if you can get into the campsite absolutely do so as it sets up a great basecamp for East Glacier hikes such as Red Rock Lake and Falls.
We did see a bear on our drive into the park!
Along lake Sherburn a large number of people stopped and were (rather idiotically) stepping ou of their vehicles to view or photograph the black bear.
Cool site to see regardless, and was thankfully the only bear we saw directly in the wild.
Waterton is also accessible for a long day trip leaving from Many Glacier campsite area, just need a passport.
We learned this since due to the generosity of a young family which let us use the other half of their group campsite since their friends weren't able to show up for another night.
We owe a great deal of our mid-trip success to those fine folks, including the recommendation to visit Red Rock sites which I genuinely cannot recommend enough.

### Getting to Glacier

So we figured we would fine a campsite along the way as there are all sorts of forested areas, right? Wrong, and awkwardly so. We ended up between Lolo and Flathead National Forests when we needed to find a campsite but were caught in the open with too much distance between both when dark hit.
Lolo is a bit out of the way, and depending on the place in Flathead can be a large time addon to get to a campsite.
Some state parks exist and we managed to find one up north by Kalispel--only all the sites were full!
So we slept in the truck that night in a parking lot in the state park, which frankly worked out better than expected as we got into Glaciar the next morning fairly early and started the long planned hike without too much difficulty.

### Overall Trails

Nearly every trail I hiked on the trip were well travelled and had a decently large number of people out.
Thankfully, the trails were well maintained and wide enough for comfortable passing without having to squeeze awkwardly by others aside from some narrow ledges on the Highline trail.
Even with all the people, approaching with an intent for the experience and knowing you are surrounded by some of the most breathtaking views at almost any turn of the trail make the journey worth it.
Every interaction we had with people was even better than we could have hoped for, the friendliness, assistance, and great conversation we had with complete strangers and rangers alike made the trip what it was.

## In Short

Anyone who is a nature lover should make the trip to Glacier within the next few decades to enjoy the glaciers before the shifting ecosystems cause permanent changes or damage to the heritage of the parks.
