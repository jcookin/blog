# Glacier National Park

What a beautiful park!

Road tripped to Glacier over a long weekend.
Took ~9 hrs from UT to Glacier with a long stop in Missoula -- a surprisingly nice place, great northern woodland aesthetic.

## Camping

### Outside the park/during travel

- Lolo National Forest
- Flathead National Forest
  - Further north and camping is a little more out of the way, but close tot he park for earlier morning arrival/late departure
- Some small state parks around also provide potential options

### In the park and immediately around

- West Glacier
  - Quartz Creek
    - Only 8? campsites, first come first serve
    - Definitely bears in the area, although we did not have any problems
    - Small site with no potable water/supplies
    - Beautiful area deep in the woods, creek nearby is gorgeous
    - Outhouse style bathroom
    - Quartz Creek hiking trail is a quarter mile or less away, feels like you get lost in the woods
      - Do not recommend hiking alone, definitely have bear spray -- bear scat was on several places in just a mile of the trailhead
  - Logging Creek
    - Closed in 2023 for maintenance/road work I believe
  - Other
    - Polebridge is worth stopping in, they have some delicious huckleberry pastries
    - There isn't any gas out in this area for miles - be sure to fill up before heading out here
    - On a combination of dirt/gravel and paved roads, late season had several deep large muddy pools across the width of the road that cannot be avoided
- East Glacier
  - **Many Glacier**
    - Cannot recommend this one enough! RESERVATION ONLY however
    - Red Rock lake & falls trail is right next to the camping, must do trails
    - Pretty far out from town, ensure gas, sites have water
  - Chewing Black Bones campground is a good non-park option at reasonable cost
  - Rising Sun
    - Walk-up sites, but get there EARLY (before 6pm) to ensure a spot
    - Going to the sun road permit required (as I recall)
    - Has shuttles through park from this campground, so can make for a good base station
  - Saint Mary
    - Walk-up sites, reserve if possible however
    - No road permit required, shuttles from campground/visitor center through park
- Other
  - There are several other sites around, many require reservations however, particularly those in west glacier

## Hiking

### Highline Trail

~13+ miles if including Grinnell Glacier Overlook and any wandering.

We started the trail from Logan Pass, which made the trail much easier being downhill most of the time.
Parked a car at The Loop in the morning, took the shuttle up to Logan Pass, and hiked back down.
The parking in the park can fill up fast, no guarantee of anything open, we just got lucky.
If driving into the park and wanting parking, earlier is better.

This trail is beautiful! Many amazing views along the entire trail and wildlife if you pay attention.
From the start there are several serene rock and water features, coupled with the views across the mountains, including down to the northeastern edge of Lake McDonald.

At the turn off to the Overlook, we met some tenacious little chipmunks who were desperate for any crumb on our snack break.
The Overlook is INTENSE. A very challenging uphill battle, but it is more than worth it.
From the overlook, climbing a little further up the mountain gives views of the lower lake as well.
The wind was wild at the top of the pass/overlook, definitely have a jacket or windbreaker.

The hike from the Overlook back to the Loop passes by the chalet which would be a fun place to stay.
The remainder from the chalet back to The Loop passed through amazing forests.

### Red Rock Lake & Red Rock Falls

### Ptarmigan Tunnel

I did not hike this trail, but it was recommended to me by a Glacier native
