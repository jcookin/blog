# Money

When is enough, enough?

## Ethics

Get rich quick, get rich slow, or get rich never?

There are hundreds or thousands or proported "Do this and make your first million" books, YouTube channels, podcasts, classes, and blogs. It's no surprise many or all are complete garbage. Paywalls, cost of a book or class, or "tools" needed to do it right, only sold by this mastermind of money. Many people, including myself, would love for these simple models to work, for effortless riches to start to flow into our accounts even if just tens or hundreds of extra dollars at a time. But these are just those, wishes and dreams revitalized by grifters with a talent for sales. Which brings this to the opening point of money: sales.

### Sales

Inherently, I find sales tactics generally unethical.
