# Purpose

2024-12-11

What is does it mean to have purpose? Better, what does it mean for an individual to have, or know, purpose?

I live here in the "greatest" times for mankind, yet is it the greatest time for individuals?
Around me is a cold winter day, in a religious, conservative valley of Utah (not out of the norm unfortunately), with the impending doom of an oligarchy, economic, moral, and civil injustice, and a manifestation of the inequality of the "classes" with the recent killing of a health insurance CEO in the streets of the most populated cities in the country.

Working for government, there is incessant waste in every avenue that is decided upon, every contract awarded. I have not seen evidence that there is value added to society in any program I have worked thus far. Spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contractors, tens of millions of dollars in consultation teams like mine own to provide technical assurance of "products", all for the continuance of mutually assured destruction.

Much, if not all, of the alternative pursuits in the technology space seem equally trivial.
Web technologies for financial transactions? A shop producing yet more e-waste products, landfill destined goods? A multinational corporation beholden to the fiduciary responsibilities of the faceless shareholders? What's the point, it's all just for the exploitation and extraction of money from one group or groups of people and into the hands of a company, shareholders, profiteers, government, what have you.

Hell, I would even consider paying taxes a lost cause now. Once I had a vision that financial policy, public services, and government programs were a net positive towards the populace. All I see forward is an oligarchy redistributing the hopes and intents of a nation into the profits and consolidation of power into the hands of even fewer, out of reach and out of touch ultra wealthy.

Where is the humanity in any of this?

The purpose, the intent of life, seems to lose it's flair in the light of true human "progress".
The brightness of a smile begins to diminish and the inability to care recedes as society continues to further isolate and contract into itself, into oneself. This is a closely realized and personal pain, with the conflict of two inclinations inside me--reclusiveness and sociability--continually at odds. Reclusiveness is a comfort, a homeostasis I wam wont to adopt all the time. To withdraw into self indulgences, self practice, personal gains of the intellectual, financial, or moral paths. Truly to escape the discomfort of people who represent conflict. To cut off  from "distraction" of love, lust, emotions, the deepest capacities of the animalistic and evolutionary needs of human soul. This is the sociability I am inclined towards in some senses. A undismissible desire of the body and deeper recesses of the mind to continue my progeny and to find cohesion as an element of a system of individuals. These are all wonderful pursuits, yet seemingly insignificant in the perspective of immediacy.

Immediacy is not restricted to basic needs or wants--food, housing, and so on. It also is relevant to the immediacy for value. This value may be derived through any of the prior mentioned avenues of self or society. Currently, too vast an amount of that value is immediately derived from work and the labor I spend a third or better of my life waking life a slave to, all for the immediate and prospective desire of money and meaning.

Yet as soon as the meaning of the work is dismissible, the value drop near zero (I don't say directly to zero since there is believably some value I can add to my immediate sense of society, even if not to self or to the broader extent of human society). Sure, there are the intellectual values derived from work, but still to what end? To what *positive* value to society have I contributed thus far? What positive values to self?

I'm tired, man. Not even hit 30 years on this madly orbiting blue ball, and yet I regularly exhaust myself with the realization that it still feels like survival every step of the way, in every day and every pursuit or every time I rise out of bed.

"Exercise and get your steps in" or "cook your own food and eat right" and "work hard for that promotion" all drag on you in the little ways wether you realize it or not. How is one supposed to also get ahead in the paths that matter for value to self? The idea of continual learning is exhausting, particularly when one feels exhausted just from the survival on the basics day to day. The idea of a family? A sustained, loving relationship? Mastery of any endeavor? To quote a masterpiece of a film for a generation, "Inconceivable!"
